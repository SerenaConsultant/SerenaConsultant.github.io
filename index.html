    <h2>About</h2>
    <p>
      As a People & Culture Management and Analysis Consultant, I specialize in designing strategic and human-centered HR practices tailored for mid and senior-level talent needs. With a solid foundation in organizational psychology, I help companies build data-driven and psychologically aligned recruitment systems that enhance team dynamics, increase long-term engagement, and support sustainable growth.
    </p>
    <p>
      My work integrates behavioral science with recruitment strategy — from psychometric tests to case-based evaluations. Whether establishing new processes or optimizing existing frameworks, I provide consultancy to align people strategy with business goals.
